# Hemodynamics Calculator - Emory School of Medicine

Welcome to the Hemodynamics Calculator developed for Emory School of Medicine. This tool is designed to assist healthcare professionals, researchers, and students in the field of cardiology, specifically in the study of hemodynamics. It provides a user-friendly interface to calculate and analyze various hemodynamic parameters, aiding in the assessment and management of cardiovascular health.

## Features

### Hemodynamic Parameters

- **Cardiac Output (CO):** Calculate CO using the Fick or thermodilution method.
- **Cardiac Index (CI):** Normalize CO for body surface area.
- **Stroke Volume (SV):** Calculate SV using CO and heart rate.
- **Systemic Vascular Resistance (SVR):** Determine SVR to assess systemic vascular health.
- **Pulmonary Vascular Resistance (PVR):** Calculate PVR to evaluate pulmonary circulation.
- **Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP):** Compute MAP from systolic and diastolic blood pressure.
- **Pulmonary Artery Wedge Pressure (PAWP):** Estimate PAWP for left heart function assessment.

### Interpretation

- Interpretation guidelines and ranges are provided for each parameter to aid in clinical decision-making.

### Data Logging

- Save patient data and calculations for future reference and analysis.

### User-Friendly Interface

- Intuitive design and easy-to-use input fields for efficient data entry.

### Educational Resources

- Access educational materials and resources related to hemodynamics and cardiovascular physiology.
